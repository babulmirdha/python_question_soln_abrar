Write a Python program that calculates the sum of all elements in a given list.
Example: Given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output 15

Q9. Write a Python program that finds the largest number in a given list
Example: Given the list [10, 20, 4, 45, 99], the program should output 99

Q10. Write a Python program that counts how many times a specific element appears in a list.
Example: Given the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5] and the target number 4, the program should output 3

Q11. Write a Python program that prints all the even numbers from a given list
Example:Given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the program should output 2, 4, 6, 8

Q12. Write a Python program that creates a new list containing the squares of all elements in a given list.
Example: Given the list [1, 2, 3, 4], the program should output [1, 4, 9, 16]

Q13. Write a Python program that creates a new list containing only the positive numbers from a given list.
Example: Given the list [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -6], the program should output [2, 4, 5]

Q14. Write a Python program that concatenates all the strings in a given list into a single string.
Example: Given the list ["hello", "world", "python"], the program should output : "helloworldpython"

Q15. Write a Python program that calculates the product of all numbers in a list
Example: Given the list [2, 3, 4], the program should output 24

Q16. Write a Python program that creates a new list containing the lengths of each string in a given list.
Example: Given the list ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the program should output [5, 6, 6].

Q17. Write a Python program using a while loop to find the sum of all the numbers in a list.
Example: Given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output 15

Q18. Write a Python program using a while loop to count how many times a specific number
appears in a list. Example: Given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5] and the number 2, the
program should output 3

Q19. Write a Python program using a while loop to reverse a list. 
Example: Given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Q20. Write a Python program using a while loop to find the smallest number in a list. 
Example: Given the list [10, 20, 4, 45, 99], the program should output 4

Q21. Write a Python program using a while loop to find the greatest number in a list. 
Example: Given the list [10, 20, 4, 45, 99], the program should output 99

Q22. Write a Python program with a list consisting of both positive and negative numbers.
Ensure that the smallest number is found correctly
Example: Given the list [12, -5, 23, -42, 8, 0, 17, -10], the program should output -42

Q23. Write a Python program that counts how many times a specific element (given by the user)
occurs in a list using a while loop.

Q24. Create a list with elements 9,8,7,6,5.
Ask the user whether they need to change any element, if the user enter "Y" - then ask for the
index and element to be inserted and change the elements in the list accordingly
Repeat it until the user enters "N" and print the new list
