# Q16. Write a Python program that creates a new list containing the lengths of each string in a given list.
# Example: Given the list ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the program should output [5, 6, 6].

fruits= ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
lengths = []

for fruit in fruits:
    length = len(fruit) # len() is a built-in function that returns the length of a string
    lengths.append() # append() is a built-in function that adds an element to the end of a list

print(lengths)
